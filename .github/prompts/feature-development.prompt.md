# Feature Development

Develop a new feature for the codebase based on the requirements provided.

## Implementation Process

1. **Understand Requirements**: Analyze ${input:requirements:Describe the feature requirements} to identify:
   - Core functionality needed
   - Affected components/files
   - Dependencies and constraints

2. **Plan Implementation**: Create a step-by-step plan:
   - Identify files that need changes
   - Determine new files/components to create
   - Consider impact on existing functionality

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Include inline documentation where needed

4. **Testing Considerations**:
   - Verify the feature works as expected
   - Test edge cases
   - Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Keep functions focused and modular
   - Add comments for complex logic

## Output Format

Provide:
- **Implementation Plan**: Overview of changes needed
- **Code Changes**: Specific file modifications and additions
- **Testing Notes**: How to verify the feature works
- **Next Steps**: Any follow-up work or considerations

Focus on ${selection} if code is selected, otherwise work with ${file} or the entire workspace as needed.
